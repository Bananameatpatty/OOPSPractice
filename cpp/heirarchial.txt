TASK

To Learn Access specifier in Hierarchical Inheritance

Write a program to implement payroll calculation for employee and student details in a origination using hierarchical Inheritance.

Step 1.Declare base class name called person, it has one integer data called employee_no, and two char array called employee_Name and designation declared as private. Followed by base class contain one public method getpersonalDetails() .

Step 2.Child class employee having five float private data member called, basic_pay,hra, da,pf and net_pay and two public method called,getEmployeeDetails(), calculate_payroll()

Step 3.Your output : net_pay = basic_pay + hra + da - pf;

Step 4.Another child class called student having three private char array data member called, student_name, college, course and two public method called getstudentDetails(),student_display().

Step 5.Your output: student name, college name,course name

Step 6.Format of Input for employee—only below given value accepted

employee_no {from 0001 to 1000}

employee_name {abc,bcd,cde,efg }

designation {admin,officestaff,manager}

Step 7.Format of Input for student —only below given value accepted

Student_name {a,b,c,d,e}

College_name {amrita}

Course {cse}

Input Format:

A single line containing the space separated integers

constraint

Nil

Output Format:

A single line containing the solution

Sample Input:

a amrita cse 0001 abc officestaff 12000 1200 1100 900

Sample Output: a amrita cse 13400


this is the template

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
//Implement your Hierarchical Inheritance
//@start-editable@



//@end-editable@
        
int main() {
   
    Student s;
    Employee e;
    s.getStudentDetails();
    s.student_display();
    e.getEmployeeDetails();
    e.calculate();
    
    return 0;
}
