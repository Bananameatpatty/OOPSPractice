In a bank, different customers have savings account. Some customers may have taken a loan from the bank. So bank always maintains information about bank depositors and borrowers.

Design a Base class Customer (name, phone-number). Derive a class Depositor (accno, balance) from Customer.

Again, derive a class Borrower (loan-no, loan-amt) from Depositor.

Write necessary member functions to read and display the details customer account and loan amount details. (All the necessary functions created for you)

Input Format:

A single line containing the user input integer

constraint

To get the loan, Minimum balance in savings account should greater than 1000

Customer phone number must 10 digits.

Loan amount greater than zero.

If above three condition need to be satisfied to sanction the loan amount. otherwise write the following statement as an output "Invalid phone number or balance or loan not taken"

Hint:

if datamember valid_phone <10 is not valid phone number.

Sample Input

B 8888888888 100 10000 001 1000

Sample Output:

customer name:B

customer phone no:8888888888

customer account no:100

balance:10000

loan no:1

loan amount:1000

this is the template:
